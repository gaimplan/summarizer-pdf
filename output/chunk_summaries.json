The compressed speech representation is subsequently packetized \nand sent over the network.  At the decoder, the Webex AI Codec reconstructs the speech \nsignal and prepares it for sound reproduction, via a loudspeaker as an example. \n \nWebex AI Codec is currently used by: \n \nCisco Webex Platform Endpoints \nWebex Meetings Webex App \nWebex Calling Webex App to Webex App calls \n \nModel Overview \nIntroduction \n \nThe Webex AI Codec model enhances speech (noise removal and de-reverberation) and \nperforms coding at low bitrates.  The model is used in conjunction with the Automatic Gain \nControl, Speech Level Estimator, and Deep REDundancy (DRED) algorithms to create a real-\ntime communication system that is resilient to network impairments (i.e. packet loss).  \nAutomatic Gain Control ensures that the input signal is within the dynamic range in which the \nmodel performs optimally.
