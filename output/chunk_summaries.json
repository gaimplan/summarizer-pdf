All rights reserve. \nPage 4 of 8  \n \n \nFeature Overview \n \nWebex AI Codec is an AI-based speech enhancement and audio codec technology aimed at \ndelivering high-quality noise-free speech under normal and challenging network conditions, for \nexample packet loss, which may occur in real-time communication systems. \n \nThe Webex AI Codec consists of three main modules: an encoder, a quantizer, and a decoder.  \nFor any given audio input captured from a microphone (i.e. noisy, reverberated speech), the \nWebex AI Codec encoder removes noise and reduces reverberation, while simultaneously \ntransforming the audio into a high dimensional latent representation referred to as the \nembedding space. \n \nThe quantizer compresses the denoised speech signal representation with a low bitrate, for \nexample 6/3/2/1 kbps.  The compressed speech representation is subsequently packetized \nand sent over the network.  At the decoder, the Webex AI Codec reconstructs the speech \nsignal and prepares it for sound reproduction, via a loudspeaker as an example. \n \nWebex AI Codec is currently used by: \n \nCisco Webex Platform Endpoints \nWebex Meetings Webex App \nWebex Calling Webex App to Webex App calls \n \nModel Overview \nIntroduction \n \nThe Webex AI Codec model enhances speech (noise removal and de-reverberation) and \nperforms coding at low bitrates.  The model is used in conjunction with the Automatic Gain \nControl, Speech Level Estimator, and Deep REDundancy (DRED) algorithms to create a real-\ntime communication system that is resilient to network impairments (i.e. packet loss).  \nAutomatic Gain Control ensures that the input signal is within the dynamic range in which the \nmodel performs optimally.  The Speech Level Estimator calculates the signal power of the \nspeech that the Webex AI Codec encoder codes.  The DRED module packetizes the current \naudio frame with copies of the previous frames so that if a packet is lost, the Webex AI Codec \ncan reconstruct the previous audio frames once the next packet is received, recovering audio \nthat would have been lost otherwise.",

Additional information on how Webex AI Codec can be used for the \nimplementation of resilient communication systems can be referenced in the Webex AI Codec \ntechnical paper. \n \nModel Architecture \n \nThe Webex AI Codec model architecture is inspired by modern neural speech codec \ntechniques as described in the Webex AI Codec technical paper, including additional \ninformation on the training of the Webex AI Codec.  The architecture, including a fully \nconvolutional encoder, a residual vector quantizer, and a decoder is depicted below: \n \n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Webex AI Codec architecture \n \nUsage Guidelines \n \nThe Webex AI Codec, and derived features, cannot be used outside of Webex applications \nand Cisco devices.  For the developer SDKs, application developers will need a Webex \nlicense, which includes the requisite permissions to develop custom applications. \n \nModel Inputs and Outputs \n \nThe Webex AI Codec model handles audio data as input (i.e. noisy, reverberant speech) on the \ntransmitter side and returns audio data as output (i.e. clean, de-reverberated speech) on the \nreceiver side. \n \nTo perform speech enhancement and coding, the encoder converts the audio input into \nembeddings, for example, a vector representation of the audio data.  A residual Vector \nQuantizer subsequently quantizes those embeddings and transmits the resulting codeword \nindexes over a communication channel to the decoder on the receiver end.  The decoder uses \nthe received information to synthesize high-fidelity output speech at its output.",

The data was either purchased, licensed, downloaded from publicly \navailable sources, or responsibly crowdsourced.

Objective tests include Perceptual Objective \nListening Quality Analysis (POLQA) and Packet Loss Concealment Mean Opinion Scores \n(PLCMOS). \n \nPerformance evaluations verified that the Webex AI Codec enhances the user experience by \neffectively reconstructing audio that would otherwise be lost due to packet loss.  This \nenhancement leads to fewer disruptions during conversations, thereby helping to boost \nproductivity.  However, these assessments also revealed the following corner cases that are \nsporadically triggered by challenging acoustic conditions: \n\u2022 In high noise level environments, brief speech segments can undergo alteration, with \ntemporary changes or distortions in the speech characteristics. \n\u2022 In highly reverberant environments, the audio output from the codec might sound \n\u201cmetallic\u201d or \u201crobotic.\u201d \n\u2022 When processing audio from simultaneous speakers in highly reverberant spaces, the \ncodec might generate unintended audio artifacts and potentially truncate short speech \nsegments. \n\u2022 Users who use medical devices to generate speech, for example electrolarynx devices, \nshould select \u201cMusic Mode\u201d in the Webex App to reduce the occurrence of potential \naudio artifacts.",
